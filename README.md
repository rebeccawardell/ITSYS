ITSYS - IT Ticketing System

This application is a high-fidelity prototype IT Ticketing System, that handles IT support ticket creation and management, as well as creating change requests and managing users and equipment. 

I have used Microsoft PowerPlatform to create a rapid application prototype that can be used as a proof of concept for senior leaders in my company. This application was created usuing PowerApps a low-code platform that allows for quick application develeopment and deployment. 

One of the main reasons I used PowerApps is because I am learning this technology to develop other apps for the company, who are keen to roll out power apps. The company has bought licences and use Micorosoft in all areas of IT.

To run this application to be able to edit, the code needs to be imported into Microsoft PowerApps.
